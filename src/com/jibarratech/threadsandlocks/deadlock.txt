In order for a deadlock to occur, you must have all four of the following conditions met:
1. Mutual Exclusion: Only one proces scan access a resource at a given time. (Or, more
accurately, there is limited access to a resource. A deadlock could also occur if a
resource has limited quantity.)
2. Hold and Wait:Processes already holding a resource can request additional resources,
without relinquishing their current resources.
3. No Preemption: One process cannot forcibly remove another process' resource.
4. Circular Wait: Two or more processes form a circular chain where each process is
waiting on another resource in the chain.
